While the taxonomy of the genus Calyptraeotheres has been well documented, its systematics and phylogenetic relationship have been a matter of debate (see Campos 1990, 1999 ;  Hern&aacute;ndez-&Aacute;vila &amp; Campos 2006 ;  Marques &amp; Pohle 1995 ).  Marques &amp; Pohle ( 1995 )  , in their phylogenetic analysis of the Pinnotheridae based on larval morphology, placed Pinnotheres politus (junior synonym of Caytraeotheres politus ) and Tumidotheres maculatus in their Pinnotheres -II group. They also concluded that both taxa were paraphyletic and transferred P. politus into Tumidotheres Campos,  1989 . Later,  Campos ( 1999 )  re-analyzed the adult morphological traits on which  Marques and Pohle ( 1995 )  based their conclusion and discovered that P. politus did not possess any of the diagnostic adult features of Tumidotheres (see,  Campos 1989 ). Nevertheless, the adult morphology of both male and female P. politus concurred very well with that of Calyptraeotheres , and this species was finally included in this genus (see  Campos, 1999 ).  Palacios-Theil et al. ( 2009 )  subsequently performed a molecular analysis of selected members of the family Pinnotheridae to ascertain their phylogenetic relationships. Their results suggested a close phylogenetic relationship between Calyptraeotheres and Tumidotheres which, collectively with the genera Dissodactylus , Clypeasterophilus and Tunicotheres , formed the so-called clade-IIC of the Pinnotherinaesensu Palacios-Theil et al. ( 2009 ,  Fig. 1 ; but see discussion on this subfamily in Campos 2009 ). Our new analysis, on the updated matrix of Marquez &amp;  Pohle ( 1995 )  , permitted to recognize that members of the genera Calyptraeotheres , Clypeasterophilus , Dissodactylus , Pinnaxodes Heller,  1865 and Tumidotheres (see  Table 1 , Pinnotherid V) share the larval characters analyzed and in general possess a very similar morphology. The larval morphology and molecular results suggest a closely relationship between Calyptraeotheres , Clypeasterophilus , Dissodactylus , and Tumidotheres but, these results mutually do not confirm the relationship of these genera with Tunicotheres and Pinnaxodes . Our results on larval morphology support a more closely relationship between the monotypic Tunicotheres and Pinnotheres taylori and in a less degree with members of the subfamily Pinnotherinaesensu Campos ( 2009 ) (see  Fig. 1&ndash;2 ). Remarkably, Tunicotheres moseri and P. t a y l o r i share a similar kind of host (tunicates) (  Rathbun 1918 ;  Campos 1996 ) and both have abbreviated larval development (see  Hart 1935 ;  Bola&ntilde;os et al.2004 ) which is highly derived. The systematics and classification of Pinnotheres taylori as well as of other crabs symbiotic of tunicates is currently under study by the first author, however, all the gathered morphological and ecological evidence suggest it, like Tunicotheres , neither belong in Pinnotheres nor in the subfamily Pinnotherinaesensu Campos ( 2009 ). The zoeae of this subfamily show a generalized and unique laterally convex telson with the furcal shafts greatly reduced to the size of the median projection and adults have a well developed protuberance on the basal antennal article (Campos 2009 ). Contrarily, the &ldquo;tunicopinnos&rdquo; have a telson subquadrate with two short lateral spines (see  Hart 1935 ) and the antennal protuberance is absent (see  Campos 1996 ). The discussion of the enigmatic molecular relationship between Tunicotheres and the Dissodactylus complex, is beyond the scope of the present paper, but probably this is the first documented molecular convergence within Pinnotheridea. Regarding Pinnaxodes ,  neither its adult morphology (  Campos et al. , 1998 ;  Takeda &amp; Masahito 2000 ;  Ng &amp; Manning 2003 ) nor the molecular results suggest this genus is allied to Calyptraeotheres or other member of the clade IIC sensu PalaciosTheil et al ( 2009 ). We consider that the shared larval features between Pinnaxodes and other members of the Pinnotherid V group are probable homoplasies, like those observed in larvae of the Pinnixa -complex and  Fabia- Juxtafabia (see  Fig. 1 ;  Palacios-Theil, et al.2009 : 457 ). </p><p> A preliminary analysis on selected adult morphological features of the carapace and third maxilliped of Calyptraeotheres suggests that is presumably more related to Dissodactylus and Clypeasterophilus than to Tumidotheres , although this would be in conflict with the molecular results of  Palacios-Theil et al. ( 2009 )  . The shared features between Calyptraeotheres and Dissodactylus - Clypeasterophilus include a glabrous subpentagonal-suborbicular carapace, and a third maxilliped with a fused ischium and merus and a carpus larger that the propodus in which, when present, a minute and rounded dactyl is inserted (  Griffith 1987 ;  Campos &amp; Griffith 1990 ; Campos 1990 ; 1999 ;  Ng &amp; Manning 2003 ;  Hernandez-Avila &amp; Campos 2006 ). Tumidotheres has a tumid and suborbicular carapare and its surface is covered with short, dense, and deciduous tomentum and the carpus of the third maxilliped is shorter that the large propodus in which the long, narrow and saptulate dactylus is medially inserted (see  Campos 1989 ). We consider that this preliminary conclusion requires an extensive morphological comparative study between all genera cited here, but emphasizing non-adaptive features. </p><p> In spite of the uncertainty on the phylogenetic affinity of the Pinnotherid V group, the only conclusion that can be fully sustained until now from an adult morphological viewpoint, is that each genus remains valid, an opinion which is supported by several unique apomorphies that uphold the monophyly of each taxon (  Griffith 1987 ;  Campos &amp; Griffith 1990 ; Campos 1990 ; 1999 ;  Campos et al.1998 ;  Takeda &amp; Masahito 2000 ;  Ng &amp; Manning 2003 ;  Hernandez-Avila &amp; Campos 2006 ;  Ocampo et al.2010 ). </p></div>","http://purl.org/dc/terms/title":"Calyptraeotheres Campos 1990","http://purl.org/dc/terms/bibliographicCitation":"Campos, Ernesto, Hernández-Ávila, Iván (2010): Phylogeny of Calyptraeotheres Campos, 1990 (Crustacea, Decapoda, Brachyura, Pinnotheridae) with the description of C. pepeluisi new species from the tropical Mexican Pacific.

Known only from the type locality, off the L&aacute;zaro C&aacute;rdenas port, Michoac&aacute;n, Pacific coast of Mexico . </p><p>Taxonomic remarks.Calyptraeotheres pepeluisinew species is the third species of the genus recorded in the Pacific Ocean. It differs from the two austral (southern hemisphere) species, C. garthi (Atlantic: Argentina and Brazil ) and C. politus (Pacific: Peru and Chile ) by its 2 -segmented MXP 3 palp (  Fig. 4 B&ndash;C) instead of a 3 - segmented palp (see  Campos 1999 ,  Fig. 4 A&ndash;B). Both C. hernandezi (Caribbean Sea: Venezuela ) and C .  granti (Mexican Pacific) share a 2 -segmented MXP 3 palp with C. pepeluisi , but this latter species is morphologically closer to the former species. Calyptraeotheres hernandezi and C. pepeluisi share a subarcuate carapace, with a fringe of setae on its anterolateral and frontal margins (  Fig. 3 A), a conical MXP 3 propodus, and dorsally visible eyes. This resemblance provides evidence that C. pepeluisi is the Pacific counterpart of C. hernandezi and that both species probably evolved after the complete closure of the Isthmus of Panama 3.1&ndash;3.5 MYA (  Keigwin, 1982 ;  Coates &amp; Obando, 1996 ). In spite of the fact that C. pepeluisi , C. hernandezi and C. granti have a 2 -segmented MXP 3 palp, it is remarkable that the shape of the propodus of this appendage in the former two species (conical) is quite different from that observed in the latter species (subtrapezoidal). Furthermore, in C. granti the eyes are not visible in dorsal view and it has a subpentagonal carapace with a glabrous margin instead of a subarcuate carapace, with the margin setose and eyes visible in dorsal view. Calyptraeotheres pepeluisi can be separated from C. hernandezi as follows: eyes proportionally smaller; posterior margin of carapace less concave; carapace without a shallow transverse T-shaped depression connecting both longitudinal sulci; and margins of ischium-merus and external margin of carpus with pinnate setae (simple setae in C. hernandezi ). Calyptraeotheres pepeluisi can be separated from its Pacific congener, C. granti , as follows: carapace with the lateral margin arcuate instead of subparallel; eyes visible in dorsal view (not visible in dorsal view in C. granti ), and MXP 3 propodus conical, not obliquely truncated as in C. granti . The host for the new species is not known. </p></div>","http://purl.org/dc/terms/title":"Calyptraeotheres pepeluisi","http://purl.org/dc/terms/bibliographicCitation":"Campos, Ernesto, Hernández-Ávila, Iván (2010): Phylogeny of Calyptraeotheres Campos, 1990 (Crustacea, Decapoda, Brachyura, Pinnotheridae) with the description of C. pepeluisi new species from the tropical Mexican Pacific.
